1. adding more on splits goes kaput
2. colors are not consistent 
3. drop zones are confusing
4. fix the menu button to be in the bar
5. fix centering name template
6. edit split sections 
7. move x for sections

NEW PRIORITY TODOS:
8. Section splitting: prevent selecting same item multiple times across tabs
   - Disable already selected items in other split tabs
   - Items selected multiple times get permanently linked
   - Deleting one deletes both, causing data loss
   
9. Section splitting: allow editing existing splits  
   - Keep original section when creating splits
   - Allow re-editing split configuration in same menu
   - User should be able to modify which items go to which split

10. Drop zones: hide redundant drop zones for already-placed sections
    - When moving existing section, hide drop zones that would place it in same location
    - Only show drop zones that actually change the section position
    - Reduces confusion during layout editing

11. Menu button: move import/export to editor tab bar
    - Move JSON import/export button next to editor tabs (far left)
    - Keep same popup functionality
    - Prevents overlap with other UI elements

12. Name template centering: fix center alignment
    - Centering name template does not actually center
    - Fix CSS alignment for proper centering
